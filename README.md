bliss metric learning
=====================

This is a small local website to perform metric learning on your
[blissify-rs](https://github.com/Polochon-street/blissify-rs/) music library.

The website makes you do your own personal survey using your music library
on which songs are close to each other. Three by three, you will point the
odd-one-out, e.g. the song that is most dissimilar in the three songs that
will be presented to you.
Each "training triplet" (as it's called) will be stored in blissify's
database, and can be used to generate playlists that are closer to your
personal tastes.

TL;DR
=====

Install required python packages:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the local survey server:

```
$ python routes.py
```

Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000, and complete the survey, answering as many rounds as you want (~200 is optimal, but 30-50 also works).

After that, stop the server by doing ctrl+c on the terminal.

Start the learning process (can take a few minutes):

```
$ python learn.py
```

Use the learned metric with blissify:

```
$ blissify playlist 300 --distance mahalanobis
```

Overall procedure
=================

(Note that this is heavily experimental, so do not expect it to directly have miraculous results!)

First, and with a working and fully analyzed [blissify-rs](https://github.com/Polochon-street/blissify-rs/) installation,
you would start the webserver by doing `python routes.py`.
You can then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ using your favorite web browser, and follow the instruction.
Rate as many songs as you want (~200 is optimal, but 50 is a very good start).

Once this is done, you can stop the webserver, and run `python learn.py`.
Note that it can take a while to do the learning, but once it is done, it should be stored directly
in blissify's config files.

You can then run `blissify playlist 300 --distance mahalanobis` to make a playlist using your newly trained
distance metric!

Technical details
================

General principle
-----------------

For the full details, see https://lelele.io/thesis.pdf, part 4: "Use of survey: metric learning".

bliss-rs represents each song as vectors with [NUMBER_FEATURES](https://docs.rs/bliss-audio/0.9.1/bliss_audio/constant.NUMBER_FEATURES.html) floating-point elements. By default, to compute distance between songs, bliss-rs uses the Euclidean distance: the distance between two songs A and B is

$`d_I(A, B) = \sqrt{(A - B)^{T}I(A - B)}`$

with I the identity matrix. We can then make a playlist by computing the distance between every song, start from a song, and queue the closest songs to this song.

However, it also possible to use any other matrix that will influence the weight of each feature (tempo, timbre, etc). For example, a matrix with a single 1 in the first column / row and zeros everywhere else would only take the tempo into account (see the [AnalysisIndex](https://docs.rs/bliss-audio/latest/bliss_audio/enum.AnalysisIndex.html) to know which element is where).

It is also possible to perform what is called "metric learning" in order to "learn" a custom distance matrix `M`, so that the distance between songs change slightly to match the learning. It is a two-steps process: the first step consists of a human answering a survey about songs, and the second of an algorithm taking the human input and summarizing it into the matrix `M`, that can then be used to compute distance between songs, just like the Euclidean distance:

$`d_{M}(A, B) = \sqrt{(A - B)^{T}M(A - B)}`$

Technicalities
--------------

In that specific case, the first process uses what's called "training triplets". The user is presented with three songs they have to listen to, and has to elect the song that is the least similar to the other two - the odd one out. Repeated a couple of times (as many times as possible), we then get a training set of training triplets.

Using these training triplets, it is possible to use metric learning by minimizing an optimization function in order to extract the matrix `M` that will keep as many distances as possible in the training set. Meaning that if A, B, C are three songs, and a user wrote that the song C is the odd one out, `M` will try to verify this equality:

$d_{M}(A, B) < d_{M}(A, C) \textnormal{ and } d_{M}(A, B) < d_{M}(B, C)$

Finally, it is possible to plug this distance matrix `M` into bliss / blissify, and make playlists using it. It should be more tailored to the user's tastes than the default identity matrix.

Future works
============

Right now it kinda works, but the whole process dates from a couple of years ago, so I am open to any thoughts / ideas of better survey and learning processes. Feel free to open an issue with ideas!
