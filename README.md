#Â bliss metric learning

This is a small local website to perform metric learning on your
[blissify-rs](https://github.com/Polochon-street/blissify-rs/) music library.

The website makes you do your own personal survey using your music library
on which songs are close to each other. Three by three, you will point the
odd-one-out, e.g. the song that is most dissimilar in the three songs that
will be presented to you.
Each "training triplet" (as it's called) will be stored in blissify's
database, and can be used to generate playlists that are closer to your
personal tastes.
